Alpi Maps is a map companion application for your hikes and bicycle trips

The app is principally made to be used with offline data. There are many kinds of offline data:
• map data (`.mbtiles` files). This can be generated with [Planetiler](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler)
• elevation data (`.mbtiles` renamed to `.etiles`). Those are rgb terrain tiles which can be generated with [rio-mbtiles](https://github.com/mapbox/rio-mbtiles)
• routing data (valhalla data `.mbtiles` renamed to `.vtiles`) which can be generated with [this](https://github.com/nutiteq/mobile-sdk-scripts#build-offline-valhalla-packages)

You can place those data in your sdcard under `alpimaps_mbtiles` and the app will pick them up. It is advised to create subdirectories per region/country.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you want help generating those files.

But the app can also with work with many online data sources like OpenStreetMap. You can set different API keys through the app Settings

Alpi Maps also helps you in managing the GPS to get your precise location when needed while keeping the battery consumption to the lowest.
Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

Alpi Maps data is base on OpenStreetMap, which means you can access almost anything anywhere in the world!
