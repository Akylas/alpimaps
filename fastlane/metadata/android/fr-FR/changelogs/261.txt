### Features
- new default source using vector tiles! It opens almost all Alpimaps features to everyone! If you dont get it by default on next app start you can add the source `AmericanaOSM` (you can remove the openstreetmap source)

### Bug fixes
- differentiate languages variants based on the locale
- new Americana OSM vector tile data source
- when selecting a park, highlight it on the map
